The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the "subject" or "observable") changes its state, all its dependent objects (the "observers") are notified and updated automatically.

This pattern promotes loose couplingâ€”the subject only knows that it has a list of observers, not what they are or what they do.

Key Concepts
Subject (or Observable): An interface or abstract class for the object that will be observed. It contains methods for attaching (register), detaching (unregister), and notifying observers.
ConcreteSubject: The actual object that stores the state of interest. It maintains a list of its observers and sends a notification to them whenever its state changes.
Observer: An interface for objects that need to be notified of changes. It typically declares an update() method.
ConcreteObserver: Implements the Observer interface. Each observer registers with a ConcreteSubject to receive updates.
Analogy: Magazine Subscription
Subject: The magazine publisher (e.g., "National Geographic").
Observers: The subscribers who have signed up for the magazine.
When the publisher releases a new issue (a state change), it automatically sends a copy to every subscriber on its list. The subscribers don't need to constantly call the publisher to ask if a new issue is out; they are notified automatically.
