The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection (like a list or an array) sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It separates the traversal logic from the collection itself.

Key Concepts
Iterator Interface: Declares the interface for accessing and traversing elements, typically with methods like hasNext() and next().
ConcreteIterator: Implements the Iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the traversal of a specific collection.
Aggregate Interface: Declares an interface for collections that includes a factory method to create an iterator object. In Java, this is the Iterable interface.
ConcreteAggregate: Implements the Aggregate interface and returns an instance of a ConcreteIterator.
Analogy: TV Remote Control
Think of a TV remote. You have channelUp() and channelDown() buttons.

The Aggregate is the list of all channels stored inside the TV.
The Iterator is the remote control's traversal logic.
You don't need to know how the TV stores its channels (in an array, a list, etc.). You just use the simple interface of the remote to navigate through them one by one.
